## What is Chatbot Solution?

A tool that helps you serve your customers conversationally by adding an AUTO BOT (a chat component is provided part of the package) to your communities. It also gives you the flexibility of using any NLP (Natural Language Processor) of your choice (Wit.ai and Api.ai provided by default).

## How do I setup the bot for my community?

Setting up the bot for the community is very simple.  
All you need to do is drag and drop the "ChatBot" Lightning component onto any Lightning page of the community.

  1\. Navigate to the <a onclick="{!c.openConfiguration}">Configuration</a> page of our app and click on create new.  
  2\. Fill in the details with the NLP platform being configured and save.  
  3\. Navigate to the community page where you are using the ChatBot Component and click on the component.
